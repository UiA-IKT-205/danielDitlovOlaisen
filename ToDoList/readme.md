The final commit lacks some functions due to when I tried to implement the other functions, the app was simply just not operable.
The app does however run decently with its base functions and uses a realtime database. Rules in Firebase was edited in order for this to work.
Implementing Firebase directly through the IDE was a challenge in the beginning as I had little to no experience with this function.
