**Knots And Crosses project.**


All in all, this project was a fun one to write. From my perspective, the app runs smoothly with no little to none bugs from my testing. A hosting method was implemented and a way of joining other lobbies is done. The main issue that i had in this project, was getting databindings to work properly, but it worked out in the end. A singleplayer mode was also attempted implemented but not complete. Code for this can be seen in applevel, **app > java > SinglePlayerActivity**.

1st image shows the homescreen of the application when it is opened. ***Create Game*** creates a online lobby. From there you get a lobby ID which you give to another player for them to join the lobby with. 2nd image shows how the joining procedure looks like.

3rd image shows a game in action. Player names is shown on top and if the player is playing as *X* or as *O*.

4th image shows the win/loss screen. Winner is shown by the text, *"X Won!"*
After a game is completed, you get a "Back" button which sends you back to the homescreen(see 1st image).
